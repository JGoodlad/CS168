Classifier and Segmenter for Brachial Plexus Nerves


This project consists of a classifer and a segmenter which can be used to achieve better results with respect to the ROI on tests where the nerve is present and not present.

For this project, we based our implmentation on the following links:
https://towardsdatascience.com/medical-image-segmentation-part-1-unet-convolutional-networks-with-interactive-code-70f0f17f46c6
http://cv-tricks.com/tensorflow-tutorial/training-convolutional-neural-network-for-image-classification/

The implementation we based our classifier on is based off of the CNN classifier presented on the tensorflow tutorial website
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn

The implementation we based our segmenter on is based off of the U-Net architecture that is presented in the following scholarly paper:
